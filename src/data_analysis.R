# We observe that Data Science students span a wider range of age categories 
# compared to Business Informatics, where no students from the age groups 18-20 
# or over 35 participated in the survey. Data Science has a larger share of 
# students with 177 compared to 32 for Business Informatics.
# Furthermore, the distribution of female students has a different shape
# compared to the overall distribution, as the size of the 21-23 age group
# exceeds that of the 23-25 group for females. As male students, 
# accounting for 156 out of 209 observations of the sample, appear more in 
# 23-25 compared to 21-23, they dominate the overall shape too.

### Q1 ###
# After 10 years of successful safety testing, on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree), would you undergo a surgical procedure to implant a cognitive-enhancement chip in your brain? #

# --> While people estimated that around 30% of people would get the implant, 
# only 7.31% of people said that they would strongly agree or agree to get the implant.
# If we count the neutral people as well, it would still only be 17.85%


### Q3 ###
# Which of the following do you perceive as the most immediate risks of neural-link technology? (Select up to 3) #

#--> A lot of people did not listen to the question and selected more than 3,
# but the analysis stays the same regardless, so it does not matter too much.
